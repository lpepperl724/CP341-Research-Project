# CP341 Research Project - Fake Biography Generator

Question: Can we create fake biographies from images of people?

Description: We want to train a GAN to identify gender, age, and other information from computer generated faces, and ultimately create a fake biography for the fake images.

Milestone 1: Obtain data

Milestone 2: Data preprocessing, getting the dataset ready

Milestone 3: Gender/age identifier: with a given image, generate appropriate gender and age (in a reasonable range) for the person in the image

Milestone 4: Biography text generation

Milestone 5: Creating webpages, human evaluation

Other thoughts: What information should be contained in a biography? Gender, age, birth date & place, occupation, political inclination, etc. may all be good. A person might also need to be ‘distinguished’ enough so that he/she owns a Wikipedia page. If the biography generated contains keywords such as ‘writer’ and ‘lawyer’, it might be fun if we could generate some book titles written by the writer or cases that the lawyer was involved in.
